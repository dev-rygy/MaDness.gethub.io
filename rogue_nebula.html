							<h2>Summary</h2>
							<p>A project made for the Video Game Design Club during their summer session. Endlessly plow through waves of enemies in the persuite of a high score. A game that is
								heavily inspired by classic arcade games like Galaga, Defender 1981, and Space Invaders. This game features a scrolling 3D envirnment, a reactive user interface,
								vibrant special effects, and an assortment of enemy behaviors.
							</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/bl_gameplay.gif" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Gameplay</h2>
							<p>The player first must choose a name to go by in order to get a leaderboard entry, if they do not choose a name they are "anonymous". The player is then imediatly
								thrusted into the first wave of enemies, in order to survive the player must dodge their flurry of bullets and fire back. The player is not completely helpless through
								as they have abilities and a secondary weapon to help them. Every eight waves the game starts upping the difficulty, after wave sixteen you are on the hardest difficulty
								and from there on you must try to survive an endless horde. This game is not easy but a verteran bullet hell player might get high into the score system.
