							<h2>Summary</h2>
							<p>Fishy Business was a group project created for a game developement class using the <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en">Gamemaker</a> engine. The main focus of the project was to simulate an environment and 
								process similar to working with a professional studio. We had deadlines, checkups, peer evaluations, design documentation, and presentations. I was the group leader and the main
								gameplay programer. A snapshot of this project can be found on our <a href="https://fishy-devs.itch.io/fishy-business">itch.io</a> page.</p>

							<h2>Gameplay</h2>
							<p>Fishy Business is a lively fishing game in which the player can freely fish in a small lake environment, sell their catches, and buy new gear.
								The player starts in a place called the "Overworld" where they can traverse a small lake area. Here, the player can	interact with the lake to fish
								and Fisher Frog to buy and sell gear. The player can buy and upgrade their rod to increase the occurance chance of fish (the chance that a more rare fish
								will spawn), thier line to increase their tension meter (a meter that appears on the screen when the player is fighting a fish  ), and their bait to
								raise bite chance (the chance that a fish will bite onto their rod). Each fish is unique and come with their own chances and value. The more rare the catch
								the more valuable the fish is to sell.
