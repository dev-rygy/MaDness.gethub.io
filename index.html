										<h2>Future Scape (2024)</h2>
										<p> A project I was tasked to develop for Enterprise Technologies. This project was to be a virtual career explorer targeted
											to students in primary and middle school. Featuring multiple minigames that explored different careers like a pharmicology, 
											manufacturing, forensic science, etc. I developed the pharmacy, manufacturing, and urban planning minigames.
											As a pharmacist give your customers the medication they need in a certain amount of time. In manufacturing build assebly lines and 
											combine components to make products that you can sell. In urban planning build your own city while managing a budget and resources at
											your disposal.

									<h2>The Devil's Diner (2023)</h2>
									<p>A project made with a small team for the Ludum Dare Game Jam #50, which is a challenge where competitors have 72 hours to create a game completely 
										from scratch. Our game stars a doomed chef who must cook for demons in Hell's most treacherous kitchen. This game features a crafting system,
										 interactable UI, a leaderboard system, cutscenes, and a level system. It was a blast working with each other on this project, so much so that 
										 we decided to port the game to mobile, which is currently in progress. All assets and artwork are my own.

										<h2>Star Raid (2021)</h2>
										<p>Star Raid was a very ambitious project that I was developing with one of my colleagues. Unfortunately, development for the game ceased due 
											to the increasingly large scope of the project and our desire to move forward with more interesting projects overweighed our decision. This game was centered 
											around co-op gameplay and featured P2P client-based multiplayer, a crafting system, A* pathfinding for enemies, raycasting projectiles, 
											and a user-based command system. All assets and artwork are my own.

									<h2>Fishy Business (2023)</h2>
									<p>Fishy Business was a group project created for a game developement class using the <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en">Gamemaker</a> engine. The main focus of the project was to simulate an environment and 
										process similar to working with a professional studio. We had deadlines, checkups, peer evaluations, design documentation, and presentations. I was the group leader and the main
										gameplay programer. A snapshot of this project can be found on our <a href="https://fishy-devs.itch.io/fishy-business">itch.io</a> page.</p>
