									<h2>Hell's Kitchen</h2>
									<p>A project made with a team for the Ludum Dare Game Jam #50 which is a challenge where competitors have 72 hours to create a game completely from scratch.
										"Our game is about a doomed cheif that must cook for demons in Hell's most treacherous kitchen. This game features a crafting system,
										Dynamic UI, leaderboard system, cutscenes, and a level system. It was a blast working with my partners on this project, so much so 
										that we decided to port Hell's Kitchen to mobil which is still a work in progress.

										<h2>Bloodlust</h2>
										<p> A project made with a friend for the Ludum Dare Game Jam treacherous#49 which is a challenge where competitors have 72 hours to create a game completely from scratch.
											This game features dynamic AI and pathfinding using a pathfinding algorithm called A*. Also a dynamic NPC scheduling system, day and night cycle,
											and a complete inventory system are just some of the amazing features we were able to implement in the 72 hour deadline.

										<h2>Star Raid</h2>
										<p>Star Raid was a very ambitios project that I've developed with my friend. Unfortunately developement for the game had stopped
											due to other responsibilities and wanting to move forward with other projects. This game was centered around co-op gameplay and
											featured P2P client based multiplayer. This game also had multiple great features like a crafting system, A* pathfinding for
											enemies, and raycasting projectiles.

									<h2>Spirit of Calamity</h2>
									<p>Spirit of Calamity is personal project that I have been working on since I started developing games. This is my passion project, and although I feel very motivated to
										create this, little has been done in development just because I'm looking for more experience before I tackle the challenge of making this 
										project a dream come true. I am not willing to share my source code for protection purposes but I can give a detailed summary of what I have 
										done with the project by clicking on "More Details". All assets and artwork are my own.
