										<h2>Rogue Nebula (2023)</h2>
										<p> A project made for the Video Game Design Club during their summer session. Endlessly plow through waves of enemies in the pursuit 
											of a high score. The game is heavily inspired by classic arcade games like Galaga, Defender 1981, and Space Invaders. 
											It features a scrolling 3D environment, a reactive user interface, vibrant special effects, and an assortment of enemy behaviors.

									<h2>Hell's Kitchen (2023)</h2>
									<p>A project made with a small team for the Ludum Dare Game Jam #50, which is a challenge where competitors have 72 hours to create a game completely 
										from scratch. Our game stars a doomed chef who must cook for demons in Hell's most treacherous kitchen. This game features a crafting system,
										 interactable UI, a leaderboard system, cutscenes, and a level system. It was a blast working with each other on this project, so much so that 
										 we decided to port the game to mobile, which is currently in progress. All assets and artwork are my own.

										<h2>Star Raid (2021)</h2>
										<p>Star Raid was a very ambitious project that I was developing with one of my colleagues. Unfortunately, development for the game ceased due 
											to the increasingly large scope of the project and our desire to move forward with more interesting projects. This game was centered 
											around co-op gameplay and featured P2P client-based multiplayer, a crafting system, A* pathfinding for enemies, raycasting projectiles, 
											and a user-based command system. All assets and artwork are my own.

									<h2>Space Journey (2022)</h2>
									<p>Space Journey was a group project created for an engineering class using p5.js. The main focus of the project was to simulate an environment and

										"stakeholders". All assets and artwork are my own.</p>
