							<h2>Summary</h2>
							<p> <!-- TODO: Summary explaination -->
								Future Scape is a project I was tasked to develop for Enterprise Technologies. This project was to be a virtual career explorer targeted
								to students in primary and middle school. Featuring multiple minigames that explored different careers like a pharmicology, 
								manufacturing, forensic science, etc. I developed the pharmacy, manufacturing, and urban planning minigames.
								As a pharmacist give your customers the medication they need in a certain amount of time. In manufacturing build assebly lines and 
								combine components to make products that you can sell. In urban planning build your own city while managing a budget and resources at
								your disposal.
							</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/bl_gameplay.gif" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Gameplay</h2>
							<p>	<!-- TODO: Gameplay explaination -->
								Gameplay varies based on the minigame experience the player enters. The player may walk through a portal to enter any experience from
								the main hub. Each minigame has unique gameplay from solving a forensic crime to giving patients the medication they need in a pharmacy.
								The games that I managed and built were the manufacturing, urban planning, and parmacist minigames. Manufacturing and urban planning carry
								alot of the same systems. A sandbox-like building system allows the player to place and remove objects that don't overlap with other objects using
								a grid system. An economy system that requires funds in order to be able to select and place objects.

											<th>Name</th>

									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td>XR Developement Kit</td>
											<td> Utalizes Unity's XR Developement Kit to build VR systems for the games. These systems include locomotion, grabbing,
												ray casting, and other interactions with a VR headset.
											</td>
											<td></td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Sandbox Building</td>
											<td> Both manufacturing and urban planning utalizes grid snapping and grid space memory in a 2D array to create a sandbox
												where the player can place objects that do not overlap or conflict with the meshes of other objects. A transparent green selector
												material is offered to each selected object to forshadow where you can place it on the grid. A remove mode is offered to the player
												to remove objects via the same button to place.
											</td>
											<td></td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Component Linking</td>
											<td> In manufacturing components can be linked via conveyer belts. Components are input/output machines that can take in multiple
												inputs and produce an output.
											</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Economy Systems</td>
											<td> In urban planning and manufacturing you must manage a budget in order to buy different objects before you can place them down.
												Income is provided in passive forms as well as active which includes shipping products and taxing buildings.
											</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Resource Management Systems</td>
											<td> In urban planning manage resources to make sure your city is functional and earning you income. 
												Each building has required and provided resources. Required resources must be satisfied before they can provide their own resources. 
												The player must balance the ratio of thier total resources and required resources in order to make their city fully functional.
											</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Particle Systems and Shaders</td>
											<td> Particles include ambiant dust in manufacturing, and fireflies in astronomy. Shaders include the portals
												in the main hub room and the relay pad in urban planning. All shaders were made using Unity's shader graph.
											</td>
