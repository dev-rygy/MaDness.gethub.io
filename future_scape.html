							<!-- Project Summary -->
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/bl_start.gif" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Summary</h2>
							<p>
								Developed for Enterprise Technologies, Future Scape is a virtual career exploration tool designed for primary and middle school students.
								The project features interactive minigames, each showcasing different careers such as pharmacology, manufacturing, forensic science, etc. 
								I specifically designed and developed the pharmacy, manufacturing, and urban planning minigames. 
								In the pharmacy minigame, players act as pharmacists, dispensing medications to patients within a time limit. The manufacturing minigame challenges 
								players to build assembly lines and create products while manating a budget. The urban planning minigame involves designing a city and
								managing resources and budgeting effectively.
							</p>
							<!-- Gameplay Description -->
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/bl_gameplay.gif" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Gameplay</h2>
							<p>	
								The gameplay varies across minigames, all accessible via portals from a main hub. Each game introduces unique challenges, from solving forensic puzzles 
								to managing complex economic systems and building cities. The games that I created employ a sandbox-like environment where players can 
								place and remove objects on a grid system without overlap, facilitated by an economy and resource system for object selection and placement.

								<table>
									<thead>
										<tr>
											<th>Name</th>
											<th>Description</th>
										</tr>
									</thead>
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td>XR Development Kit</td>
											<td> 
												Leverages Unityâ€™s XR Development Kit to create immersive VR experiences, featuring locomotion, grabbing, 
												raycasting, and other interactive elements suitable for a VR headset.
											</td>
											<td></td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Sandbox Building</td>
											<td> 
												Utilized in both manufacturing and urban planning, this feature includes grid snapping and spatial memory for object placement.
												The player may place and remove objects in a way that does not conflict with the placement of others. The player may rotate and
												select a variety of objects with the help of transparent green silhouette in the shape of the selected mesh.
											</td>
											<td></td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Component Linking</td>
											<td> 
												In manufacturing, components are machines that can be linked via conveyor belts to create assembly lines. 
												A complex system handles items that interact with with these components, input item(s) are detected and accepted if a 
												possible output item can be created.
											</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Economy Systems</td>
											<td> 
												Both in urban planning and manufacturing, the player must manage a budget in order to purchase and place objects in the
												world. Income can also be provided through passive means to help the player build quickly and prevent soft locking.
											</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Resource Management Systems</td>
											<td> 
												In urban planning, managing resources is critical to making sure your city is stable and functional. 
												Each building has required and provided resources. Required resources must be met before a building can be taxed. 
												Players strategize to balance required and available resources to optimize city operations.
											</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Particle Systems and Shaders</td>
											<td> 
												Particles include ambient dust in manufacturing, and fireflies in astronomy. Shaders include the portals
												in the main hub room and the relay pad in urban planning. All shaders were made using Unity's shader graph.
											</td>
