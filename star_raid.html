						<h2>Summary</h2>
						<p>Star Raid is a game that I started with my friend back in 2020, we planned on making it into a full game but decided to 
							halt the progression due to the scope being too large and wanting to move onto a project more tangable. The game is set in Space
							with a focus on multiplayer. The player(s) must try to survive against multiple waves of aleins that invade the ship that's stranded
							in deep space.
						</p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/star_gameplay.gif" alt="" /></span>
						<h2>Gameplay</h2>
						<p>The game starts in the hanger of the ship. The player(s) spawn near their crashed ship, they must explore and survive the alien waves that invade
							the ship frequently. The ship is randomly generated which means that each run the loot and rooms on the ship change. Special rooms hold machines that
							are vital to the ships functions. The radar helps locate valuable loot, the generator powers the ship and keeps the lights on, etc. The player(s)
							must defend the machines as much as they can or risk their defense and scavage for loot. The players can craft items and structures that can help 
							them defend the ship and repair. Some items require heavy defending as the container they are in can be easily destroyed by enemies. The end goal
							is to repair their former ship, the big ship they are on, or take an escape pod.

										<td>Co-op done using Mirror, an open source netowrking tool for Unity. A Player's system would act as a server and connect
											to all the other clients. This system is highly subject to cheating but we did not plan to have any sourt of competitive play or
											leaderboard system so we thought it was ok for our type of model.

										<td>Bullet Raycasting</td>
										<td>To save on performance we decided to use raycasting/hitscan for the bullets. Bullets would still come out of the gun but would

										<td>Placeable Objects</td>
										<td>Certain objects in the Player's inventory could be placed on a ground tile and would act as either an aid for the player or a defense
