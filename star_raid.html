							<p>A restless spirit is rare a spirit that embodies the soul of it's host. It is summoned after the host's demise only if the death was caused by great distress
								or some kind of important duty was not fullfilled. It's is true, its origins remain unknown but some say this spirit is a division of some kind of Spirit of Calamity; a very powerful
								spirit that is capable of having the abilities of a demi-god. As a restless spirit, the player traverses a large castle where many untold horrors lie. Your goal is to
								find why you were summoned and to carry out your destiny.
							<p>Spirit of Calamity is perhaps the sole idea of what really got me into game design. As a child I have been facinated with my ability to create intricate worlds and
								plots that even surprise me at times. And because in a video game you can create just that and whatever you can imagine, I never doubted becoming a game designer was
								the career path for me. Spirit of Calamity is the birth of my creativity, it's a world I've fantasized about since I was a teenager and one I wish to see badly come to life. 
								I could spend countless hours talking about the lore and story of the game. This is the game I'm most passionate about and I won't settle for less than <strike>perfect</strike>
								*nearly perfect*.
